	35 000 children die every day as a result of poverty. This is a completely unnecessary travesty. Poverty is man-made and man can eradicate it. The official policy of Norway and the world as defined through the millennium goals is only the reduction, not eradication of poverty. Our goal must be to eradicate poverty!
	</b>
</p>
<p>
Stop Poverty is a youth based and inter-religious campaign to stop poverty completely. We need to fight the root causes of poverty with non-violent means. We want to see policy empowerment of young people and policy change by duty bearers. We need to build a broad based global social movement. When social activists took on the struggle to abolish slave trade the task was enormous. The struggle to end apartheid was also extremely ambitious and difficult to achieve. However, through global social movement-building, they managed to dismantle the injustice. Poverty is created by specific political and economic policies. As global activists for justice and peace we need to influence decisions by policymakers, as well as our own and our fellow citizens' attitudes and practices. By building a global movement for justice and peace, we can resist and change the policies. We can stop poverty.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Policymakers are found at different geographical levels: local, regional and global. YMCA and YWCA are present at all these levels with individual members, groups, branches, national movements, and regional and global alliances. The YWCA is the largest women movement in the world today and the YMCA is the largest youth organization. We have the network already, and we can build the movement.
</p>
<p>
	The Stop Poverty campaign is developed by KFUK-KFUM Global. The campaign was launched in the summer of 2011 and moves on with a broad specter of activities aimed at generating knowledge, commitment and to influence Norwegian and international policy.
</p>
<p class="bold"><b>
	How can we believe that eradicating poverty is possible?
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	Great things have been accomplished in human history through broad social mobilization. Those who started the struggle against slavery took on a monumental task. Through broad mobilization they succeeded in making slavery illegal. They did this in the face of strong opposition.
</p>
<p>
	When social activists decided to end apartheid the goal was infinitely ambitious and tremendously hard to accomplish. But as we know – they won the struggle. Their strategy included a global social mobilization.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	KFUK-KFUM is part of two large international networks – YMCA and YWCA. We are well placed to get the balls rolling – and we have begun. 
</p>
<p class="bold"><b>
	How will we achieve this?
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	<em>It is manmade policy that creates poverty.</em> This policy must be opposed with effective, non-violent and accessible means. This policy robs developing countries of their resources. Solidarity and cooperation between young people in the South and in the North is necessary. Some policy areas must be changed in the North (trade policy, tax policy, capital flight, climate policy and debt policy) and some areas in the South (accountability, transparency, taxation, trade and more).
Timing is everything. The emphasis of the campaign will shift depending
on which policy areas are in critical and decisive phases.

	The United Nations has defined poverty as a financial term – the daily income of a person. It is distinguished between extreme and absolute poverty. Extreme poverty is living for less than $1,25 a day, and absolute is for less than $2,00. The definition says little about a person’s situation regarding health, level of education or civil rights. However, it is a measure which is easier to work with in the various parts of the world. In the Millennium Development Goals, developed by the United Nations in 2000 as a global summit to reverse the hunger, poverty and diseases affecting billions of lives, the first goal is regarding eradication of extreme poverty and hunger. However, the goal is not defined as eradication, but the target is to “halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people whose income is less than $1,25 a day”. Furthermore, it says that the target was already met in 2010. In 2010, 700 million fewer people lived in the condition of extreme poverty than in 1990. Even so, 1,2 billion people are still extremely poor. (http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/poverty.shtml (26.08.2013))
</p>
<p>
The United Nations uses the term extreme poverty, but the definition of absolute poverty is not widely used. Today, 2.6 billion live in absolute poverty, for less than $2,00 a day. We think that eradication of extreme poverty is important, but we can still not accept the huge number of people living in absolute poverty. Living in absolute poverty is yet living in poverty which includes the lack of basic needs. Therefore, we use the term of absolute poverty in the Stop Poverty campaign.
</p>
<p class="bold"><b>
	The Overall Demands
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	The Millennium Development Goals will be replaced by the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, which is also called the post-2015 agenda. These goals will target the year of 2030. That is the reason for our headline and approach to the campaign to be “Zero poor in 2030”. 
</p>
<p>
	We cannot accept the target of the Millennium Development Goals, which said to halve the number of people living in extreme poverty. We think that is the same as saying it is acceptable that still 1,2 billion people live for less than $1,25 a day. Hence, our overall demands and what we ask all state leaders to commit to, is:
</p>
<ul class="bold"><b>
	<li>
		Eradicating absolute poverty by 2030. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Formulating and implementing poverty eradicating policies that are based on justice and human rights.
	</li>		
	<li>
		Pushing for ambitious and binding Sustainable Development Goals.
	</li>
</ul></b>
<p>
	It is not enough to reduce the amount of people living in poverty; we have to eradicate the poverty. That is our message to the world leaders when we push for ambitious Sustainable Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>
	These demands are in first place targeting the United Nations before 2015. After 2015, towards 2030, we need more specific goals and demands for implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. These working areas must be done on all levels, eradicating poverty on the ground, on a national level with policies and priorities with the base of justice and on the global level with the decisions that has to be done in a global scale to be implemented. We want justice, equality and human rights. These values are implemented differently in the various regions of the world. Each country has to work individually but with the same principles and within the global Y movement. Regardless of the differences, we will use the resources of our different communities to broaden our perspective and exchange the ideas of changing the world. 
</p>
<p>
	In Norway, our campaign demands are at this point connected to five main areas: New sustainable development goals, economic justice, climate justice, peace and democratic citizenship.
</p>
<p class="bold"><b>
	New Development Goals
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	We need to aim for more ambitious development goals. The current Millennium Development Goal aim to reduce extreme poverty by 50 %, and the main strategy is to increase aid. Y Global stresses that we must aim to eradicate absolute poverty. 
</p>
<p>
	<em>
		The Stop poverty campaign therefore demands a 100% reduction in absolute poverty (as defined by UN) as development goal for 2030.
	</em>
</p>
<p>
	The poverty eradication must be based on principles for social and economic justice, not more aid. We need to form partnerships across the globe to change policies so that unjust resource leakages is plugged and economic resources are spent to deliver right based social services to people of all nations. 
</p>
<p class="bold"><b>
	Economic justice 
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	The Stop poverty campaign’s main objective on economic justice is that young people are empowered to take control of their finances and create political structural change that ensures economic justice from local to global level. Economic justice is a concept in which the economic policies must result in a fair and sustainable distribution of benefits to all. This is the basis for peace and a just world:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Tax justice: We support the idea of paying taxes regardless of capacity. We do not accept tax avoidance and tax evasion from rich companies and individuals. This creates lack of income for developing countries in the hundred million dollar class. These avoidances and evasions reduce developing countries’ capacity to offer their citizens are entitled to, for instance in health and education. Therefore, we support:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Country by country reporting: All multilateral companies have to report all expenses to the governments in each country they are operating.
			</li>
			<li>
				Publish what you pay: a global network and campaign for more transparency in the extractive industries. This includes, among other demands, countries’ implementing of the EITI-principles (Extracting Industries Transparency Initiative).
			</li>
			<li>
				Robin Hood tax: a small tax on all financial transactions to finance public services and climate change adaptation
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Trade justice: We support the fight for a fair global trade system that makes it possible for developing countries to access both the domestic market and foreign markets. Today, many countries struggle to access the North markets and the “dumping” of subsidized products from the North makes it hard to even compete with local products in domestic markets. Hence, we support the following to promote trade justice
		<ul>
			<li>
				Fair market access in Northern markets
			</li>
			<li>
				Developing countries’ right to protect their markets against dumping and allow protection of local production when it can create employments.
			</li>
			<li>
				Global regulations of corporate investments, such as Foreign Direct Investments and portfolio investments, to secure social and environmental decent work standards on all production. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Fair patent regulation; which includes a ban of buying patents on biological material and fair prices on patents on medicine technology. This can strengthen the availability of cheap medicines in areas where it is mostly needed.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Debt and Finance Justice: We support the work of cancelling debt that undermine countries’ opportunity to ensure public service to their populations. We cannot accept that creditors experience respect when irresponsible loans are given to illegitimate regimes or purposes, and when new governments and leaders still pay back these loans. We support:&nbsp;
		<ul>
			<li>
				Cancellation of all unpayable debt; a debt is unpayable when a country has to cut down on public services to pay back the debt.  
			</li>
			<li>
				Cancellation of all illegitimate debt, which is loans given to illegitimate regimes, purposes or with illegitimate conditionality
			</li>
			<li>
				Responsible lending regulations to make sure new illegitimate loans are not provided and that loans are not given when grants are available
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<p class="bold"><b>
	Climate- and environmental justice
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	Y Global supports the social movements calling for justice in all environmental policies. We find it completely unacceptable that individuals and companies can pollute natural environments without paying the total price of the same pollution. The goal of the Stop poverty campaign is that youth have become active citizens in the struggle for justice in climate- and environmental policies from local to global level. We want to join the struggle for environmental and climate justice by promoting the following policies: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		New global binding climate agreement committing all industrial nations to substantially reduce carbon emission to guarantee the two degrees target. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Provision of funding for developing countries to adapt to the changes that are unavoidable, for instance through the Robin Hood tax or a CO2-fee on shipping and aviation industries.
	</li>
	<li>
		Strict regulation of pollution by companies and enforcement of environmental rights of communities living next to production sites.
	</li>
	<li>
		We challenge the consumer power to avoid buying from for instance companies with membership in American Petroleum Institue (API). API is engaged in actively lobby to stop a global climate agreement. 
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="bold"><b>
	Just peace
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	Peace is essential for sustainable development and for protecting human dignity. Therefore, the Stop poverty campaign aims to make youth actively involved in creating peace through inter-religious cooperation for a just development of society. Reconciliation and peace building are fundamental interventions for upholding human dignity. The Stop poverty campaign aims to contribute to an environment conducive to sustainable long-term development through just peace. Religious communities are a relevant presence at all levels of civil society and have great potential for peace building. Furthermore, this strategy will empower youths to use non-violent tools to fight for justice as well as mobilizing youth in the struggle to stop gender-based violence. 
</p>	
<p>
	Just peace is sought after in individual and family levels where the focus will be on livelihood, life skills and skills for dignified lives. Local society level will focus on basic services and keeping local authorities accountable. National and global levels focus on political change that ensures the whole person’s human rights.
</p>
<p class="bold"><b>
	Democratic Citizenship
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	The Stop poverty campaign promotes an understanding of democratic rights in young people and wants to empower them for active democratic participation from local to global level. This area is cross cutting in the sense that it serves as a basis for the other programs to be implemented effectively. Democratic citizenship is inspired by the African Alliance of YMCA’s program «From Subject to Citizen» and a gender perspective is fully integrated. The program aims to provide essential knowledge and motivate the participants to increased involvement as citizens in their local communities as well as engagement in major global issues. Youth of the world will be listened to concerning issues such as poverty, climate justice and violation of basic human rights.
